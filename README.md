# Night Shift

![Night Shift](night-shift.png)

While you sleep, an AI agent works across your repositories. You wake up to fresh PRs and you decide what you want to keep. 

## Get started

**Install (run in your shell, not in Claude):**

```bash
npx skills add frontkom/night-shift
```


Or fetch the single file directly — no CLI required:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/night-shift && \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/skills/night-shift/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/night-shift/SKILL.md
```

**Use:**

In any Claude Code session, type:

```
/night-shift
```

Claude will walk you through setup interactively — pick repos, choose tasks, confirm before anything is created.

Night Shift supports two backends:

| Backend | How it runs | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Routine** | Claude Code routines (runs on your account) | Claude subscription — no API key needed |
| **GitHub Actions** | GitHub-hosted runners via a reusable workflow | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in org/repo secrets + `gh` CLI |

During setup, `/night-shift` runs a **per-repo task picker** — for each repo you add, you choose which of the tasks should run nightly. Defaults are all-on. To change a repo's selection later, re-run `/night-shift` and pick **Change tasks for a repo**.


## What you'll find in your repo tomorrow morning

- **Implemented plans** — picks the next phase from a `docs/*-PLAN.md` file and opens a PR
- **Updated docs** — changelog entries, user guide pages, decision records
- **New test coverage** — fills coverage gaps following your existing test patterns
- **Fixed accessibility issues** — WCAG AA violations on key pages
- **Translated UI strings** — moves hardcoded text into your i18n system
- **Audit PRs** — security, bug, SEO, and performance issues
- **Triage comments on red CI** — every failed or cancelled check on a Night Shift PR gets an explanatory comment by morning, with cancellations and clearly-unrelated flakes already re-run

Every Night Shift run leaves a labelled PR per task (`night-shift`), so `gh pr list --label night-shift` is the audit trail — no per-repo log file is written. The bundle is recoverable from the PR title prefix (`night-shift/plan:`, `night-shift/bug:`, `night-shift/a11y:`, etc.).

## The bundles

| Bundle | What it does | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **plans** | Implements the next phase of a planning document | One PR per plan |
| **docs** | Updates changelog, user guide, decision records, suggestions | One PR per task |
| **code-fixes** | Adds tests, fixes accessibility, completes translations | One PR per task |
| **audits** | Finds security / bug / SEO / performance issues | One PR per area |
| **triage-ci** | Comments on red checks on Night Shift PRs, re-runs cancellations + clearly-unrelated flakes | Comments only, no new PRs |

`manifest.yml` is the single source of truth for what tasks exist, what they do, what bundle they belong to, and what order they run in. Edit one file to add, rename, reorder, or move tasks.

## GitHub Actions

To use the GitHub Actions backend, an org admin needs to add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as an **organization secret**:

1. Go to your org's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Click **New organization secret**
3. Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, Value: your Anthropic API key
4. Repository access: select the repos Night Shift will manage (or "All repositories")

This is a one-time setup. Once the secret exists, any repo member can run `/night-shift`, choose **GitHub Actions**, and the skill will create PRs with the workflow file — no local clone needed.

You also need the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`) installed and authenticated on your machine for the setup process.

## Jira integration (optional)

Night Shift can pick up **Jira issues** labelled `night-shift` and turn them into PRs — same shape as the GitHub Issues path, just sourced from a Jira Cloud project. Auth is handled via the **Atlassian Rovo** MCP connector that Claude maintains via OAuth — no API tokens, no env vars, no secret storage on Night Shift's side.

### Per-developer setup (one time, ~3 minutes)

Each developer who wants to use Jira with Night Shift does this checklist on their own Claude account:

**1. Connect Atlassian Rovo.** Open https://claude.ai/customize/connectors → find **Atlassian Rovo** in the directory → **Connect** → complete the Atlassian OAuth prompt. Verify with `claude mcp list` (you should see `claude.ai Atlassian Rovo: ✓ Connected`).

**2. Set tool permissions to "Always allow".** Still on the Atlassian Rovo page in the connectors UI, you'll see three permission groups: **Interactive** (5 tools), **Read-only** (11 tools), **Write/delete** (3 tools). Each defaults to **Needs approval**. Flip all three to **Always allow** (the ✓ icon). Routines run at 3 AM with no human to click "approve" — without this, every Rovo tool call hangs the routine.

   The five tools the task actually calls — `Search with JQL`, `Get issue`, `Get transitions`, `Transition issue`, and the comment-adding tool — straddle Interactive and Read-only, so flipping all three groups is the simplest "set it and forget it" choice. (Write/delete is needed if the comment tool lives there.)

**3. Run `/night-shift` in Claude Code.** When the task picker asks, tick `work-on-jira-issues` for each repo where you want this active. The skill prompts for the Jira project key per repo and prints the snippet to paste into that repo's `CLAUDE.md`.

**4. Add the Jira project key to each opted-in repo.** Under `## Night Shift Config` in `CLAUDE.md`:

   ```
   ## Night Shift Config
   - Jira project key: FGPW
   - Jira label: night-shift   # optional; omit to default to night-shift
   ```

   Commit + merge.

**5. Label issues.** Tag any open Jira issue with `night-shift`. The next nightly build picks up the three oldest, opens one GitHub PR per issue, comments back with the PR link, and best-effort transitions each issue to **In Progress**.

The task self-skips silently when the project key is missing or the Rovo connector isn't attached to the routine, so partial setup is safe — you can opt a repo in via the picker first and finish the OAuth flow later without seeing failure noise.

### Bootstrap caveat (first developer only)

The skill auto-attaches Rovo to the build routine using the connector's account-scoped UUID. To read that UUID via the API, **at least one routine on the account must already have Rovo attached**. The very first developer enabling Jira on a fresh account hits one extra step:

> Open https://claude.ai/code/routines → edit any routine (the build routine works) → toggle **Atlassian Rovo** on in the connectors panel → save. After that, re-run `/night-shift`. The skill discovers the UUID from the populated routine and propagates it everywhere.

Subsequent developers (and subsequent routine creates on the same account) skip this step entirely — the UUID is already discoverable.

## Stopping Night Shift on a project

Add **either**:
- An empty file `.nightshift-skip` at the repo root
- A line `Night Shift: skip` in `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `README.md`

The wrapper reports `opted-out` for that repo and moves on.

## Customising per project

Add a `## Night Shift Config` section to the project's `CLAUDE.md`. All fields are optional — anything unset uses sensible defaults autodetected from your `package.json` and repo layout.

```markdown
## Night Shift Config
- Doc language: Norwegian (nb)
- Test command: npm test
- Build command: npm run build
- Push: git push mirror main && git push origin main
- Key pages: /dashboard, /surveys, /people
```

## Recommended target-repo setup (optional)

These are hints, not requirements — your org may already have its own standards. 

**Enable a merge queue on `main`.** Night Shift opens several PRs in parallel at night. Without a queue, every PR sits on its original tree all day. As siblings land, each remaining PR goes stale — missing modules, merge conflicts, stale CI aggregators — and you spend your morning rebasing instead of reviewing. A merge queue rebases each PR onto fresh `main` and re-runs required checks at merge time, so freshness is guaranteed.

Suggested settings (GitHub → Settings → Rules → ruleset for `main`):
- Add a `merge_queue` rule: method `SQUASH`, grouping `ALLGREEN`.
- Keep required status checks; the queue re-runs them on the rebased commit.
- Allow merge method: squash only (keeps history linear).


**Selective human review for Night Shift PRs only.** If you don't want blanket "require 1 approval" on every human PR, but *do* want human approval before Night Shift PRs land, add a small workflow that gates on the `night-shift` label. Then mark `nightshift-review-gate` as a required status check. Human PRs skip it automatically; Night Shift PRs block on it until approved.

**Aggregator checks should treat `cancelled` as neutral, not failure.** If you use an aggregator job (one that waits on `needs:` and succeeds only if children pass — common for multi-app monorepos), make sure it only fails on `failure`. Otherwise, when concurrency cancels an older run (a common, desirable thing), the aggregator latches to red and the PR stays `BLOCKED` even though every real test passed. We got bitten by this three times in one night before fixing it.
