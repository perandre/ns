# Night Shift — How To

## For users

### Set up, add a project, check status
Type `/night-shift` in any Claude Code session. The skill walks you through it and asks before any routine change.

### Pick which tasks run per repo
During setup, for each repo in your list, the skill opens a real keyboard-navigable checklist (Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion` UI) showing all 13 tasks in bundle order: plans, docs, code-fixes, audits, triage-ci. Use arrows + space to toggle, enter to confirm. Defaults are all-on; the 4 audit tasks come with a warning that they open PRs nightly when they find issues. The single `triage-ci-failures` task only comments on existing Night Shift PRs (no new PRs), so it's safe to leave on for every repo.

The selection lives inside the routine prompts as a `<night-shift-config>` YAML block, not in any per-repo file. To change a repo's selection after setup, run `/night-shift` and pick **Change tasks for a repo**.

### Pause Night Shift on a project
In the project repo, do either of these:
- `touch .nightshift-skip` at the repo root
- Add a line `Night Shift: skip` to `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `README.md`

The next run reports `opted-out` and skips it. Remove the marker to re-enable.

### Run a bundle now without waiting
- **Schedule backend:** Open https://claude.ai/code/routines, click a routine, click **Run now**.
- **GitHub Actions:** Go to the repo's Actions tab → Night Shift → **Run workflow**.

### Customise per project
Add a `## Night Shift Config` section to the project's `CLAUDE.md`. All fields optional — see the example in `README.md`. Without it, Night Shift autodetects sensible defaults.

### Monorepos with multiple apps
If a repo holds several apps owned by different teams (a Turborepo with `apps/web` and `apps/admin`, for example), list them under an optional `apps:` block. Night Shift fans out most tasks to one subagent per app, so each team sees PRs scoped to their own code. Without the block, everything runs as a single app (same as today).

```markdown
## Night Shift Config
- Default branch: main
- Push: pr
- Doc language: en

apps:
  - path: apps/web
    test: pnpm --filter web test
    build: pnpm --filter web build
    key pages:
      - apps/web/app/page.tsx
      - apps/web/app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx
    plans dir: apps/web/docs
  - path: apps/admin
    test: pnpm --filter admin test
    build: pnpm --filter admin build
    key pages:
      - apps/admin/app/dashboard/page.tsx
```

Each `apps[]` entry overrides the top-level `test`, `build`, `key pages`, and `plans dir` for that app. Top-level fields are used as a fallback when an app entry omits them, and by tasks marked `scope: repo` in `manifest.yml` (ADRs, suggestions, secret scanning) which always run once per repo regardless of the `apps:` list.

## For framework maintainers

### Add a new task
1. Create `tasks/<task-id>.md` with the full task prompt. Copy any existing task file as a template.
2. Add an entry under `tasks:` in `manifest.yml`:
   ```yaml
   - id: check-outdated-deps
     title: Check for outdated dependencies
     description: Reports outdated packages and opens a PR.
     bundle: audits
     mode: pull-request
     order: 5
     scope: app   # or `repo` for cross-cutting tasks — see below
   ```
3. Commit and push to `main`. The bundle prompt resolves its task list from `manifest.yml` at runtime — **no bundle file edit needed**. Live on the next run.

The `scope` field controls monorepo fan-out. `scope: app` (default) tasks run once per app in repos with an `apps:` block; `scope: repo` tasks always run once per repo. Use `repo` for cross-cutting work like ADRs, repo-wide suggestions, and secret scans. In single-app repos the two behave identically.

### Rename or reorder a task
Edit `manifest.yml`. If the `id` changes, `git mv` the `tasks/<id>.md` file to match. Commit and push to `main`. Live on the next run.

### Add or rename a bundle
Edit the `bundles:` map in `manifest.yml`, then rename/create the matching `bundles/<id>.md` and `bundles/multi-<id>.md` files. Update the routine prompt to point at the new `multi-*` URL.
