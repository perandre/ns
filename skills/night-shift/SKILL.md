  Set up, run, or manage Night Shift — a framework that schedules nightly maintenance jobs across multiple repositories. Supports two backends: Claude Code routines (Schedule) or GitHub Actions (reusable workflow). Night Shift runs plans implementation, doc updates + code fixes, and audit PRs across the user's chosen repos.

  Use this skill when the user explicitly asks to: install Night Shift, set up Night Shift, schedule Night Shift, run a Night Shift bundle, add a repo to Night Shift, remove a repo from Night Shift, pause Night Shift on a project, or check Night Shift status.

  MANDATORY TRIGGERS: night-shift, night shift, nightshift, /night-shift, set up night shift, install night shift, schedule night shift, run night shift, night shift setup, night shift install

# Night Shift

<!-- NIGHT_SHIFT_VERSION: 2026-04-30a -->

## Version check (run this first, every invocation)

Before doing anything else, check whether this local skill file is out of date:

1. Fetch the latest version marker from GitHub (one request, ~1 KB):
   ```
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/skills/night-shift/SKILL.md | grep -m1 NIGHT_SHIFT_VERSION
   ```
2. Compare the returned date against the `NIGHT_SHIFT_VERSION` comment at the top of this file.
3. If the remote is newer, auto-update the local file:
   ```
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/skills/night-shift/SKILL.md -o ~/.claude/skills/night-shift/SKILL.md
   ```
   Then **re-read** the updated file with the Read tool (`~/.claude/skills/night-shift/SKILL.md`) and follow the updated instructions from that point on. Tell the user:
   > Night Shift skill updated (local: `<old>` → `<new>`).
4. If the curl fails (offline, rate limited), silently skip the check and proceed with the local version.

Night Shift is a framework for scheduled nightly maintenance jobs across multiple repositories. It uses Claude Code routines (scheduled remote agents) to spawn nightly sessions that run a fixed set of bundles (groups of tasks) against the user's chosen repos.

The full source and the bundle / task prompt files live at:
**https://github.com/frontkom/night-shift**

That's the canonical reference. If you ever need to check what a bundle does, look there.

## Concepts

- **Task** — one atomic prompt file that does one thing in one repo (e.g. `add-tests`, `update-changelog`, `find-security-issues`).
- **Bundle** — a group of related tasks that run together. Four bundles total: `plans`, `docs`, `code-fixes`, `audits`.
- **Multi-* wrapper** — a meta prompt that auto-discovers all repos cloned into a session and dispatches one Task subagent per repo, then prints a summary table.
- **Routine** — a scheduled remote agent (created via the `/schedule` skill or `RemoteTrigger` tool) that fires nightly and runs a multi-* wrapper. (The API tool is still called `RemoteTrigger`; the UI calls them "Routines".)
- **Manifest** — `manifest.yml` in the night-shift repo, the source of truth for what tasks exist and how they group into bundles.

## Operations

Default to **Setup** unless the user clearly asks for something else (test once, add/remove a repo, status, update the skill).

## Setup runbook

**Step 0 — Check for existing Night Shift setup (both backends).**

Before welcoming the user, check both backends:

1. **Schedule:** List routines via the `RemoteTrigger` tool (`action: "list"`) and filter to names starting with `night-shift-`.
2. **GitHub Actions:** Search for `.github/workflows/night-shift.yml` in sibling directories and common locations (`~/Sites`, `~/Projects`, `~/Code`, `~/repos`, `~/dev`). A repo has Night Shift via GHA if this file exists and references `frontkom/night-shift`.

Then:

- **If nothing found (no routines, no workflow files)** → proceed to Step 0b (choose backend).
- **If existing setup found** → don't run fresh setup. Show what's already in place across both backends and ask what they want to do:

  > Night Shift is already set up:
  >
  > **Schedule (routines):** *(if any routines found)*
  > | Job | Schedule | Repos |
  > |---|---|---|
  > | build | `<local time>` | `<repo list>` |
  > | maintain | `<local time>` | `<repo list>` |
  > | audit | `<local time>` | `<repo list>` |
  >
  > **GitHub Actions:** *(if any workflow files found)*
  > | Repo | Schedule | Tasks |
  > |---|---|---|
  > | `owner/repo-a` | `<cron>` | `<N>` tasks |
  >
  > What would you like to do?
  > - **Add a repo** (runs the task picker for the new repo)
  > - **Remove a repo**
  > - **Change tasks for a repo** (re-run the picker for one existing repo)
  > - **Change the schedule**
  > - **Pause** a job / workflow
  > - **Delete everything** and start over (re-choose backend)
  > - **Add GitHub Actions** to more repos (if using Schedule and want to expand with GHA)
  > - **Nothing** — just wanted to check

  Dispatch to the matching runbook section based on which backend the repo uses. For "Add a repo", ask which backend to use (or infer from context — e.g., if the user only has one backend set up, use that). Never silently re-create routines that already exist. For "Delete everything and start over", delete all routines and workflow files, then restart from **Step 0b** (choose backend) so the user can pick fresh.

**Step 0b — Choose backend.**

Ask the user how they want Night Shift to run:

> **How should Night Shift run?**
>
> - **Schedule** — runs via your Claude account's routines (no API key needed, included in your subscription)
> - **GitHub Actions** — runs on GitHub's infrastructure (requires `gh` CLI and an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your org/repo secrets — see [setup docs](https://github.com/frontkom/night-shift#github-actions))

- If **Schedule** → continue to Step 1 below (existing flow, unchanged).
- If **GitHub Actions** → jump to the **GitHub Actions setup runbook** section below.

---

**Step 1 — Welcome and explain, then ask one question.**

Send a single message that welcomes, states what Night Shift will do for them, and asks only for the repo list. Example:

> **Welcome to Night Shift.** I'll set up three scheduled jobs that run every night on your chosen repos:
>
> - **Build** — implements planned features from your plan files
> - **Maintain** — keeps docs in sync with code and fixes quality issues
> - **Audit** — opens PRs for security and bug findings
>
> You can pause, add, or remove repos any time.
>
> **One question to get started: which GitHub repositories should Night Shift manage?** Paste URLs, one per line or comma-separated (`owner/repo` or full URL, personal or org, both work).

Accept any of: `https://github.com/owner/repo`, `owner/repo`, `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`. Normalise to `https://github.com/owner/repo` (strip `.git`). If the user gives zero repos, stop and tell them to come back when they have at least one.

**Step 2 — Per-repo task picker.**

For each repo in the list, in the order the user gave them, run the picker loop below. You build up an in-memory map `selection[repo] = [task_id, …]` that gets baked into the routine prompts in Step 4.

**Picker defaults:** all tasks recommended per repo.

**Picker loop** (one `AskUserQuestion` call per repo, 3 questions per call):

1. Fetch `manifest.yml` once and cache it for the session.

2. Call `AskUserQuestion` with **3 questions**, all `multiSelect: true`. Mention the repo URL and progress (`repo N of M`) in the first question. Each option's `label` is the task id (e.g. `find-bugs`) and `description` is the human title from `manifest.yml`. Phrase questions to make clear all tasks are recommended.

   **Question 1 — "Plans + Docs"** (header: `Plans+Docs`):
   - `build-planned-features` — Build planned features
   - `work-on-issues` — Work on tagged GitHub issues
   - `work-on-jira-issues` — Work on tagged Jira issues (requires per-repo Jira project key + the Atlassian Rovo MCP connector attached to the build routine; see "Atlassian Rovo (Jira)" below)
   - `update-docs` — Update all documentation (changelog, user guide, ADRs, suggestions)

   **Question 2 — "Improve code quality"** (header: `Improve`):
   - `add-tests` — Add tests
   - `improve-accessibility` — Improve accessibility
   - `improve-seo` — Improve SEO
   - `improve-performance` — Improve performance
   - `translate-ui` — Translate UI

   **Question 3 — "Find issues"** (header: `Find issues`):
   Warn that active tasks here open PRs nightly when they find issues.
   - `find-security-issues` — Find security issues
   - `find-bugs` — Find bugs

   **Meta-option expansion.** `update-docs` is a picker shorthand, not a real task id. When building `selection[repo]`, expand it to the four individual doc task ids: `update-changelog`, `update-user-guide`, `document-decisions`, `suggest-improvements`. The allowlist and routine config always use real task ids from `manifest.yml` — never the meta-option name.

3. Merge selected ids from all 3 questions into `selection[repo]` and move to the next repo. If the user selected nothing across all questions, record the empty set — the create step will skip the repo.

4. **Jira follow-up (only if `work-on-jira-issues` was selected for this repo).** Ask one extra `AskUserQuestion` with two free-text fields:
   - `jira_project_key` — required, e.g. `FGPW`. The Jira project whose tagged issues should become PRs in this repo.
   - `jira_label` — optional, default `night-shift`. The label to filter on.

   Store these on `selection[repo].jira = { project: <KEY>, label: <LABEL> }` for use in Step 5's summary.

   Then tell the user (do **not** push to their repo for them — they paste it into their CLAUDE.md):

   > Add the following to **`<repo>/CLAUDE.md`** under `## Night Shift Config` before the next routine run:
   >
   > ```
   > - Jira project key: <KEY>
   > - Jira label: <LABEL>   # optional, omit to default to night-shift
   > ```
   >
   > I'll walk you through the Atlassian Rovo connector setup before I create the routines (it's a one-time per-account flow — connect Rovo, flip tool permissions to "Always allow", and a possible one-click bootstrap if no routine has Rovo attached yet). Until that's all in place the task self-skips silently — no failure noise.

5. There is no `back` step. If the user wants to change a previous repo's picks, they can use "Change tasks for a repo" after setup completes.

**Step 3 — Schedule confirm.**

Show a compact summary of the picker output and the default schedule, ask for confirmation:

> **Selections:**
>
> | Repo | Tasks |
> |---|---|
> | `owner/repo-a` | 8 selected (plans, docs, code-fixes) |
> | `owner/repo-b` | 3 selected (find-bugs, improve-seo, improve-performance) |
>
> **Schedule** (Europe/Oslo, weeknights only): build 01:00, maintain-code 03:00, audit 04:00, maintain-docs 05:00.
>
> Skips Friday and Saturday nights — people rarely review PRs on Saturday or Sunday.
>
> Proceed?

Default schedule → UTC cron, weeknights only: build `0 23 * * 0-4` (Sun-Thu UTC night → Mon-Fri morning), maintain-code `0 1 * * 1-5`, audit `0 2 * * 1-5`, maintain-docs `0 3 * * 1-5` (Mon-Fri UTC).

Two reasons for this ordering:

1. **Docs runs LAST so it can summarize what the night actually did.** `update-changelog` scans `git log` for user-facing commits and `suggest-improvements` (Mode B) checks if existing suggestions are now implemented. Both give stale answers if they fire before code-fixes and audits. With docs at 03:00 UTC, it sees the commits and PRs the build / code-fixes / audits wrappers landed over the previous five hours.
2. **The build routine fires before midnight UTC** so it uses days 0-4 (Sun-Thu) to produce Mon-Fri morning PRs; the others fire after midnight so they use 1-5 (Mon-Fri). All four schedules deliberately skip producing PRs visible Saturday or Sunday morning.

If the user wants to tweak schedule, timezone, or include weekends, do it now, then proceed on explicit confirmation. If they decline, stop.

**Step 4 — Create the routines.**

**Which routines get created.** Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/manifest.yml` (you already fetched it for the picker in Step 2 — reuse the cache) and compute, per routine, the set of task ids that belong to it by bundle membership:

- **build routine** — tasks where `bundle: plans`.
- **maintain-docs routine** — tasks where `bundle: docs`.
- **maintain-code routine** — tasks where `bundle: code-fixes`.
- **audit routine** — tasks where `bundle: audits`.

**Do not hardcode task ids in the skill.** Always derive them from `manifest.yml` so new tasks added later flow through automatically.

A routine is created only if at least one repo's selection has a non-empty intersection with that routine's task set.

**If a routine's task set is empty across all repos, do not create that routine.** Tell the user which ones were skipped and why in Step 5's summary. The next time the user adds a task back in via "Change tasks for a repo", the skill re-creates the missing routine.

**`sources[]` per routine.** Include only repos whose selection includes at least one task belonging to that routine's bundles. A repo with zero tasks in a bundle is not cloned for that routine — it saves compute and keeps the summary clean.

**Inline the wrapper prompt.** Remote agents sometimes refuse "Fetch URL and execute" instructions, treating them as prompt injection. To avoid this, **fetch each wrapper prompt yourself during setup and inline its contents as the routine prompt**. For each routine:

1. Fetch the wrapper file from GitHub using WebFetch (URLs below).
2. Use the fetched content as the routine's prompt text.
3. Append the `<night-shift-config>` block at the end.

**Inline the allowlist.** Each routine's prompt gets a `<night-shift-config>` block appended at the end. For each routine, list only the tasks from its bundle that each repo selected. **Never put a task id in a routine's YAML that doesn't belong to that routine's bundles** — the wrapper ignores mismatched ids, but keeping the YAML clean makes the routines dashboard easier to read.

Use the `RemoteTrigger` tool with `action: "create"`. **Do not** include `https://github.com/frontkom/night-shift` in sources — that repo is public and writing run logs to it would leak private project information.

**Fetching the environment_id (required, one-time).** The API requires a real `environment_id` — using `"default"` causes sessions to silently hang with no output. To get it:

1. Call `RemoteTrigger` with `action: "list"`.
2. If any routines exist, grab `job_config.ccr.environment_id` from one of them — done.
3. If **no routines exist** (first-time setup), walk the user through a quick bootstrap:
   - Tell them: *"I need to grab your environment ID. Go to **claude.ai/code/routines → Create routine**, enter any test prompt (e.g. 'say hello'), pick any repo, and save. Come back when done — I'll grab the ID and clean up the test routine."*
   - Wait for the user to confirm, then `list` again to capture `environment_id`.
   - Delete the bootstrap routine if the user wants (or repurpose it).

This only happens once — the `environment_id` is stable per account. Cache it for all routines in this session.

**Exact API body structure.** The RemoteTrigger API nests settings inside `job_config.ccr`. `mcp_connections` is a sibling of `job_config` (top-level), not nested. Here is a complete example for one routine — follow this structure exactly:

```json
{
  "name": "night-shift-build",
  "cron_expression": "0 23 * * 0-4",
  "enabled": true,
  "job_config": {
    "ccr": {
      "environment_id": "<real environment_id — see fetching instructions above; NEVER use 'default'>",
      "session_context": {
        "model": "claude-opus-4-7[1m]",
        "allowed_tools": ["Bash", "Read", "Write", "Edit", "Glob", "Grep", "WebFetch", "WebSearch"],
        "sources": [
          { "git_repository": { "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo" } }
        ]
      },
      "events": [
        {
          "data": {
            "type": "user",
            "uuid": "<generate a unique uuid>",
            "session_id": "",
            "parent_tool_use_id": null,
            "message": {
              "role": "user",
              "content": "<the inlined wrapper prompt + night-shift-config block>"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "mcp_connections": []
}
```

Generate a fresh UUID for each routine's `events[0].data.uuid` using `python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`.

**Jira preflight — runs once when any repo's selection includes `work-on-jira-issues`.** Walk the user through this preflight before creating any routines. It has four checks; each gates on the previous one. Stop and instruct the user the moment any check fails — never proceed with a half-configured routine.

**Check 1: Is Rovo connected at the account level?** Run:

```bash
claude mcp list 2>&1 | grep -i "atlassian rovo"
```

Expected: a line containing `claude.ai Atlassian Rovo: ✓ Connected`. If you see `! Needs authentication` or no line at all, tell the user:

> The Atlassian Rovo connector isn't connected on your Claude account yet. Open https://claude.ai/customize/connectors, find **Atlassian Rovo** in the directory, click **Connect**, complete the Atlassian OAuth prompt. Then come back and re-run `/night-shift`.

Stop. Don't create routines until Rovo is connected.

**Check 2: Are tool permissions set to "Always allow"?** This **cannot be detected via API** — per-tool permission state isn't exposed in `RemoteTrigger get` and isn't readable from the local config. Always remind the user, every time:

> One thing I can't check from here: tool permissions. Routines run autonomously at 3 AM with no human to approve "Needs approval" tool calls — those calls would just hang the routine forever. Open https://claude.ai/customize/connectors → **Atlassian Rovo** → set **Interactive**, **Read-only**, **and Write/delete** all to **Always allow** (the ✓ icon). All three groups, simplest "set it and forget it". Confirm here when done.
>
> *(`AskUserQuestion`: "Have you flipped all three groups to Always allow?" — Yes / Not yet → if not yet, stop and wait.)*

**Check 3: Can the skill discover the connector UUID via the API?** Run `RemoteTrigger list`. For every returned routine, scan `mcp_connections[]` for an entry where `name` (case-insensitive) matches `atlassian-rovo` or `atlassian rovo`. Cache the first hit's `connector_uuid`, `name`, and `url`.

If found, the skill is fully automated from here — proceed to Check 4.

If **not** found (no existing routine has Rovo attached — the bootstrap caveat), tell the user:

> Rovo is connected on your account but I can't read its account-scoped UUID via the API yet — the API only exposes the UUID once at least one routine has Rovo attached. One-time bootstrap step: open https://claude.ai/code/routines → edit any routine (the build routine works; doesn't have to stay there) → toggle **Atlassian Rovo** on in the connectors panel → save. Then come back and re-run `/night-shift`. The skill will pick up the UUID and propagate it. This step only happens once per Claude account.

Stop. Don't create the build routine without the UUID.

**Check 4: Set `mcp_connections` on the build routine.** Using the cached UUID:

```json
[{"connector_uuid": "<cached uuid>", "name": "<cached name>", "url": "<cached url>", "permitted_tools": []}]
```

For routines other than the build routine, set `mcp_connections: []` — none of the other bundles use Jira tooling.

### Routine 1 — Build

- **name**: `night-shift-build`
- **cron_expression**: `0 23 * * 0-4` (Sun-Thu UTC night → Mon-Fri morning; skips Fri+Sat night so no Sat/Sun morning PRs)
- **wrapper URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/bundles/multi-plans.md`
- **prompt**: Fetch the wrapper URL with WebFetch, then use its full contents as the prompt. Append the `<night-shift-config>` block at the end.

### Routine 2 — Maintain (docs)

- **name**: `night-shift-docs`
- **cron_expression**: `0 3 * * 1-5` (Mon-Fri UTC, **runs LAST** so it can summarize the night's plans / code-fixes / audits work; skips Sat+Sun mornings)
- **wrapper URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/bundles/multi-docs.md`
- **prompt**: Fetch the wrapper URL with WebFetch, then use its full contents as the prompt. Append the `<night-shift-config>` block at the end.

### Routine 3 — Maintain (code fixes)

- **name**: `night-shift-code-fixes`
- **cron_expression**: `0 1 * * 1-5` (Mon-Fri UTC; skips Sat+Sun mornings)
- **wrapper URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/bundles/multi-code-fixes.md`
- **prompt**: Fetch the wrapper URL with WebFetch, then use its full contents as the prompt. Append the `<night-shift-config>` block at the end.

### Routine 4 — Audit

- **name**: `night-shift-audit`
- **cron_expression**: `0 2 * * 1-5` (Mon-Fri UTC; skips Sat+Sun mornings)
- **wrapper URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/bundles/multi-audits.md`
- **prompt**: Fetch the wrapper URL with WebFetch, then use its full contents as the prompt. Append the `<night-shift-config>` block at the end.

**Step 4b — Handle the routine cap.**

If the user's plan rejects the create with `trigger_limit_reached`, tell them:

> Your account's routine limit has been reached. List your existing routines and tell me which to delete. The Night Shift API can't delete — you'll need to delete them via https://claude.ai/code/routines.

**Step 5 — Summarise.**

Once all routines that should exist have been created, print:

```
✓ Night Shift is set up.

| Routine | Schedule | Repos | Tasks |
|---|---|---|---|
| build | <local time> | <N> | <M> selected |
| docs | <local time> | <N> | <M> selected |
| code-fixes | <local time> | <N> | <M> selected |
| audit | <local time> | <N> | <M> selected |

(Skipped: <any routines not created because no repo selected any of their
tasks — list them here, or "none" if all four were created.)

Tomorrow morning, review the night's PRs in each repo with
`gh pr list --label night-shift` (filter by title prefix —
`night-shift/bug:`, `night-shift/a11y:`, etc. — to narrow to a
specific bundle). The full summary table for each run is
also in the routines dashboard at https://claude.ai/code/routines. To
pause Night Shift on any project, drop a .nightshift-skip file at its
root. To change which tasks run on a repo, re-run /night-shift and pick
"Change tasks for a repo". See https://github.com/frontkom/night-shift
for the full reference.
```

## Atlassian Rovo (Jira) — connector setup

`work-on-jira-issues` does **not** use API tokens. It talks to Jira through the **Atlassian Rovo** MCP connector, which Claude manages via OAuth — no long-lived secrets to store.

### One-time account setup

Open https://claude.ai/customize/connectors, find **Atlassian Rovo** in the directory, click **Connect**, and complete the Atlassian OAuth prompt. After this, `claude mcp list` shows `claude.ai Atlassian Rovo: ✓ Connected`.

### Attaching Rovo to the build routine (the skill does this automatically)

Account-level connectors do **not** auto-propagate into routines — every routine in `RemoteTrigger list` shows `mcp_connections: []` until explicitly populated. The `mcp_connections` field on a routine takes this shape (verified 2026-04-28 by inspection; not officially documented):

```yaml
mcp_connections:
  - connector_uuid: <uuid>           # account-specific; same for all routines on this account
    name: Atlassian-Rovo
    url: https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp
    permitted_tools: []              # empty = use the connector's default per-tool permissions
```

When **any** repo's selection includes `work-on-jira-issues`, the skill must attach Rovo to the build routine.

**Discovering the connector UUID.** The UUID is account-scoped. The skill discovers it by:

1. Calling `RemoteTrigger list` to inspect existing routines.
2. Searching across all routines for the first `mcp_connections[]` entry whose `name` matches `Atlassian-Rovo` (case-insensitive — observed values: `Atlassian-Rovo`, possibly `Atlassian Rovo` or `atlassian-rovo` on different accounts).
3. Reusing its `connector_uuid` for the build routine being created/updated.

If no existing routine has Rovo attached (first-time setup), the skill instructs the user:

> Atlassian Rovo is connected on your account, but no routine has it attached yet, so I can't read its account-scoped UUID via the API. Please open https://claude.ai/code/routines, edit any routine, and toggle **Atlassian Rovo** on in the connectors panel. Save. Then re-run this step — I'll discover the UUID and propagate it.

This is a one-time bootstrap; once any routine has Rovo, the skill can read the UUID from there forever.

### Permissions: required step

The connector splits its 31 tools across three approval groups in the claude.ai UI: **Interactive** (5), **Read-only** (11), **Write/delete** (3). Each group defaults to **Needs approval**. For autonomous routines this is fatal — no human is awake at 3 AM to click "approve", so the routine hangs at the first Rovo tool call.

**The user must flip all three groups to "Always allow"** at https://claude.ai/customize/connectors → Atlassian Rovo. The skill cannot flip these via API — per-tool permission state isn't exposed in `RemoteTrigger get`'s output (`permitted_tools: []` reflects only the routine-level override, not the connector-wide setting).

The five tools the task uses — `Search with JQL`, `Get issue`, `Get transitions`, `Transition issue`, plus a comment-adding tool — straddle Interactive and Read-only (and possibly Write/delete for commenting). Flipping all three groups is the simplest "set it and forget it" choice. The skill always reminds the user; do not skip this reminder.

### Per-repo project key

Each repo that opted in still needs `Jira project key:` (and optionally `Jira label:`) in its `CLAUDE.md` `## Night Shift Config`. The picker's Jira follow-up step printed the snippet — the user pastes it into the repo themselves.

## Test-once runbook (no scheduling)

When the user wants to try Night Shift on the current repo without scheduling anything:

1. Ask which repo they want to test (default: the current working directory).
2. Confirm: "I'm about to run all four bundles against this repo. Plans → docs → code-fixes → audits. Each bundle commits its own changes. Test on a branch first if you want to inspect before keeping. Confirm?"
3. On confirm: walk through the four bundles in order, applying their rules. Most tasks self-skip if not applicable (no plans → silent, no UI → a11y silent, etc.).
4. Print the same summary table format as the multi-* wrappers.

## Parse-merge-rewrite contract

All post-setup operations (add repo, remove repo, change tasks) must **read the current routine prompt, parse the `<night-shift-config>` YAML block, merge the change in memory, and rewrite the prompt** — never regenerate from scratch. This preserves any hand-edits the user made in the routines dashboard (different wrapper URL, extra instructions, etc.).

Steps, for each of the four routines in turn:

1. Read the routine's current `prompt` via `RemoteTrigger` (`action: "get"`).
2. Locate the `<night-shift-config>` / `</night-shift-config>` delimiters. If absent, treat the current state as "all tasks allowed for all repos" and synthesise a full map from the current `sources[]`.
3. Parse the YAML, apply the change (add key, remove key, replace value), re-serialise.
4. Splice the new YAML back between the delimiters, preserving everything else in the prompt.
5. Update `sources[]` to match the union of `repos:` keys.
6. Write back via `RemoteTrigger` (`action: "update"`).

If merging produces an empty `repos:` map for a routine, **delete that routine** (not just update it). If a merge would re-populate a routine that was previously deleted, **re-create it** using the Step 4 template from the Setup runbook.

## Add a repo

1. Ask the user for the repo URL(s). Normalise the same way as Step 1.
2. For each new repo, run the **Step 2 picker loop** so the user selects its tasks.
3. For each of the four routines, parse-merge-rewrite: add the repo to `sources[]` and to the `repos:` map with its selected tasks (filtered to the tasks belonging to that routine's bundles).
4. If a routine doesn't currently exist but the new repo has tasks for it, create it fresh using the Setup Step 4 template.
5. Print a summary of which routines were updated / created, the repos added, and the task counts.

## Remove a repo

1. Ask the user which repo(s) to remove from the installation.
2. For each of the four routines, parse-merge-rewrite: drop the repo from `sources[]` and from the `repos:` map.
3. If a routine's `repos:` map becomes empty, delete the routine entirely.
4. Print a summary.

## Change tasks for a repo

1. List the current routines and their `repos:` keys so the user can pick a repo. (Reject input for repos that aren't present in any routine.)
2. Parse the four routine prompts to recover the repo's **union** of currently selected tasks across bundles — this is the starting state for the picker.
3. Run the **Step 2 picker loop** for that one repo, pre-checked with the current selection.
4. For each of the four routines, parse-merge-rewrite: replace the repo's entry in `repos:` with the new selection filtered to that routine's bundles. Remove the repo entirely from a routine if no task in that routine's bundles is selected. Add it back to `sources[]` and `repos:` if new tasks in a routine's bundles are selected.
5. Create or delete routines as needed when the map goes from empty → non-empty or vice versa.
6. Print a diff-style summary: "repo-a: +add-tests, -find-bugs".

## Status

Check both backends and show a unified view:

**Schedule backend:** List the user's current routines via the `RemoteTrigger` tool (`action: "list"`). Filter to names starting with `night-shift-`. Show name, cron (converted to local time), and the repos in `sources[]`.

**GitHub Actions backend:** Search for `.github/workflows/night-shift.yml` in sibling directories of the current working directory and common locations (`~/Sites`, `~/Projects`, `~/Code`, `~/repos`, `~/dev`). For each found, parse the `tasks:` value. Show repo path, cron schedule, and task count.

Present both in a single summary:

> **Night Shift status:**
>
> **Schedule (routines):**
> | Job | Schedule | Repos |
> |---|---|---|
> | build | ... | ... |
>
> **GitHub Actions (workflow files):**
> | Repo | Schedule | Tasks |
> |---|---|---|
> | owner/repo-a | 01:00 UTC weeknights | 8 tasks |

## GitHub Actions setup runbook

This runbook is used when the user chooses **GitHub Actions** in Step 0b. The Schedule backend (above) remains completely separate — this section does not touch routines.

**GA-Step 1 — Welcome and explain, then ask for repos.**

> **Welcome to Night Shift (GitHub Actions mode).** I'll generate a workflow file for each repo and create PRs on GitHub.
>
> **Prerequisite:** GitHub CLI (`gh`) — installed and authenticated.
>
> **Which GitHub repositories should Night Shift manage?** Paste URLs, one per line or comma-separated.

Before proceeding, verify `gh` is available and authenticated:
```bash
gh auth status
```
If not installed, tell the user to install it (`brew install gh` on macOS, or see https://cli.github.com) and authenticate with `gh auth login`. Do not proceed until `gh` is working.

Accept any of: `https://github.com/owner/repo`, `owner/repo`, `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`. Normalise to `https://github.com/owner/repo`.

**GA-Step 2 — Per-repo task picker.**

Use the exact same picker as the Schedule backend's Step 2 (same questions, same format, same meta-option expansion). Build `selection[repo] = [task_id, …]`.

**GA-Step 3 — Schedule confirm.**

Show the same compact summary as the Schedule backend's Step 3, but adapted:

> **Selections:**
>
> | Repo | Tasks |
> |---|---|
> | `owner/repo-a` | 8 selected |
> | `owner/repo-b` | 3 selected |
>
> **Schedule:** `0 1 * * 1-5` (weeknights 01:00 UTC). Adjust?
>
> Each repo gets a `.github/workflows/night-shift.yml` that calls the
> shared reusable workflow at `frontkom/night-shift`.
>
> Proceed?

**GA-Step 4 — Generate workflow files and create PRs.**

For each repo in `selection`:

1. Build the task list string: join `selection[repo]` with commas.

2. Generate the caller workflow file from the template at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/github-actions/caller-template.yml`. Fetch it once and cache. Replace the `tasks:` value with the repo's selected tasks. Replace the `cron:` value if the user customised the schedule. Replace `COMMIT_SHA` in the `uses:` line with the latest commit SHA from the night-shift repo (run `git ls-remote https://github.com/frontkom/night-shift HEAD` to get it). This pins the workflow to a known-good version for supply-chain safety.

3. Create a PR on GitHub using the `gh` CLI — **no local clone needed**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new branch and commit the workflow file directly on GitHub
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/git/refs/heads/main -q '.object.sha'  # get base SHA
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/git/trees -f base_tree=BASE_SHA \
     -f 'tree[][path]=.github/workflows/night-shift.yml' \
     -f 'tree[][mode]=100644' \
     -f 'tree[][type]=blob' \
     -f 'tree[][content]=<FILE_CONTENT>'  # create tree
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/git/commits \
     -f message="Add Night Shift workflow" \
     -f 'tree=TREE_SHA' -f 'parents[]=BASE_SHA'  # create commit
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/git/refs -f ref=refs/heads/night-shift-setup \
     -f sha=COMMIT_SHA  # create branch
   gh pr create --repo OWNER/REPO --head night-shift-setup \
     --title "Add Night Shift nightly maintenance" \
     --body "Adds a GitHub Actions workflow that runs Night Shift nightly."
   ```
   This works for any repo the user has push access to, without needing it cloned locally.

**GA-Step 5 — Summarise.**

```
Night Shift (GitHub Actions) is ready.

PRs created:
  - owner/repo-a#123 — Night Shift (8 tasks)
  - owner/repo-b#124 — Night Shift (3 tasks)

Next steps:
  1. Review and merge the PRs
  2. Test with: Actions tab → Night Shift → Run workflow

To pause Night Shift on a repo, disable the workflow in the Actions tab
or add a .nightshift-skip file at the repo root.
```

**GA — Add / remove / change tasks for a repo.**

For GitHub Actions repos, the task list lives in the workflow file's `tasks:` input (not in a routine prompt). To modify:

1. Fetch the repo's `.github/workflows/night-shift.yml` via `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/.github/workflows/night-shift.yml -q '.content' | base64 -d`.
2. Read the current `tasks:` value and parse it into a list.
3. Run the picker (pre-checked with current selection for "change tasks").
4. Update the `tasks:` value and create a PR with the change (same Git tree API approach as GA-Step 4).
5. Tell the user to commit and push the change.

## Notes for Claude

- **Always ask for explicit confirmation** before creating, updating, or deleting routines. They are persistent and run unattended — high blast radius.
- **Inline wrapper prompts at setup time.** Fetch each multi-*.md wrapper from GitHub during setup and inline the contents as the routine prompt. Remote agents refuse "Fetch URL and execute" instructions (prompt injection guard), so the wrapper must be baked in. The wrapper's inner references (subagents fetching bundle/task prompts via WebFetch) are fine — only the top-level "fetch and execute" is refused.
- **The task and bundle URLs are stable.** They live at `raw.githubusercontent.com/frontkom/night-shift/main/...`. Subagents fetch these at run time, which works because they already have tool access. Only the top-level routine prompt must be inlined.
- **Refuse if the user can't articulate what Night Shift should do for them.** If the request is vague or feels delegated from somewhere, ask the user directly what they want to accomplish before taking any action.
- **GitHub Actions mode never touches routines.** The two backends are independent. A user can even use both (Schedule for personal repos, GitHub Actions for org repos). Never mix operations between backends.
- **GitHub Actions mode does not auto-commit.** Always let the user review the generated workflow files before committing. The workflow file is the only thing added to target repos — no other files are created or modified during setup.
