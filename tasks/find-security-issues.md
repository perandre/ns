# Security Audit

Scan for OWASP Top 10 patterns. **One PR per issue.**

## Read project config first
Read `CLAUDE.md` for **Night Shift Config**: test command, build command, default branch, push protocol. If the dispatcher passed `allowed_tasks` and `find-security-issues` is not in it, exit silently.

**Scoping.** Secret scanning is always repo-wide. The OWASP code review is per-app when the dispatching multi-runner passes an `app_path` (non-empty, not `—`):
- If `app_path` is set, review only code under `<app_path>` for injection / auth / CSRF / XSS patterns.
- Run the repo-wide secret scan pre-step **only** when the multi-runner tells you to (first work-item of a repo). Subsequent app work-items skip the secret scan.
- Use the app-scoped test and build commands from the scoped config.
- Branch and PR title include the app slug: `nightshift/security-<app-slug>-YYYY-MM-DD` and `nightshift/security: <app_path> — <short description>`.

Without an `app_path`, behave as before (whole repo, no app slug).

## Pre-step — repo-wide secret scan (skip when the runner says so)
Regardless of app scope, once per repo per night, grep the whole repo for accidentally committed secrets: API keys, tokens, private URLs, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` with sensitive values. If found, file the fix under a plain `nightshift/security-secrets-YYYY-MM-DD` branch (no app slug — it's a repo-wide concern) and return.

## Steps
1. Check for existing open night-shift security PRs to avoid duplicates:
   ```
   gh pr list --search "nightshift/security in:title" --state open
   ```
2. Look for patterns (inside `<app_path>` when scoped; skip the "Exposed secrets" row here — it's handled by the pre-step above):
   - **Auth bypass / broken access control** — routes/handlers that read user IDs from request without authorization checks (IDOR)
   - **Injection** — raw SQL string building, shell exec with user input, unsafe template eval
   - **XSS** — `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML`, unescaped output in templates
   - **Exposed secrets** — API keys, tokens, private URLs in client bundles, public repos, or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
   - **CSRF** — state-changing routes without origin/CSRF protection
   - **Missing rate limiting** on auth, signup, password reset, expensive endpoints
   - **Insecure deserialization, SSRF, open redirects**
3. Pick **one** real, non-speculative issue tonight. Skip anything that requires guessing about intent. When scoped, the issue and its fix must live under `<app_path>`.
4. Create a branch (include the app slug when scoped):
   ```
   # scoped:
   git checkout -b nightshift/security-<app-slug>-YYYY-MM-DD
   # unscoped:
   git checkout -b nightshift/security-YYYY-MM-DD
   ```
5. Fix the issue at the smallest reasonable scope. Add a regression test.
6. Run the scoped **test suite** and the scoped **build command**. Both must pass.
7. Push and open a PR (prefix the title with `<app_path> — ` when scoped):
   ```
   gh pr create --title "nightshift/security: <app_path> — <short description>" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   <what was vulnerable, in 1-2 sentences>

   ## Risk
   <impact if exploited>

   ## Fix
   <what changed and why this is the right fix>

   ## Verification
   <how the new test demonstrates the fix>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

## Idempotency
- One issue per night, one PR per issue.
- If a similar PR is already open or merged recently, skip the issue.
- If no real issues are found, exit silently — never fabricate findings.
